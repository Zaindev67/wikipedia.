    <p>Edward the Elder(c. 874 – 924) was King of the Anglo-Saxons from 899 until his death. He was the elder son of Alfred the Great and his wife Ealhswith. When Edward succeeded to the throne, the Vikings ruled Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern Mercia, leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control. In 910 a Mercian and West Saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading Northumbrian army, ending the threat from the northern Vikings. In the 910s, Edward conquered Viking-ruled southern England in partnership with his sister Æthelflæd, who ruled Mercia. By 919 he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule. Edward was admired by medieval chroniclers, but he was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, partly because few primary sources for his reign survive. He is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred united English kingdom. (Full article...)

    <p>Four of the original Wiggles and a fan</p>    
    <p>The discography of the Wiggles, an Australian children's musical group, includes fifty-nine studio albums, three live albums, nine compilation albums, one extended play and thirty-seven singles. The band was formed in 1991 by Murray Cook, Jeff Fatt, Anthony Field, Greg Page and Phillip Wilcher when they recorded The Wiggles as part of a student project at Macquarie University in Sydney, New South Wales, where several members were studying early childhood education. Eighteen of the group's albums have been certified by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) as Gold, Platinum and double Platinum. Since 2018, the group's newer line-up have seen three of their albums reach the top ten on the ARIA Albums Chart. The group's cover of Tame Impala's "Elephant", which they performed on Triple J's Like a Version, became the group's first top-ten single, peaking at number 10 in January 2022 after it reached number 1 on the annual Triple J Hottest 100 poll for 2021. The group's 2022 tribute album ReWiggled debuted as their first number-one album. (Full list...)

    <p>The lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) is one of the largest known species of jellyfish, with a range confined to the cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. These photographs depict a lion's mane jellyfish in Gullmarn, a fjord on the western coast of Sweden, with its bell alternately expanded (top) and contracted (bottom). The specimen was likely a juvenile, with a bell 10 to 12 centimetres (3.9 to 4.7 in) in diameter and tentacles 60 to 80 centimetres (24 to 31 in) in length. The largest recorded individual of the species had a bell approximately 210 centimetres (7 ft) wide and tentacles around 36.6 metres (120 ft) long.</p>
